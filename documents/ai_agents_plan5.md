# Comprehensive AI Agent Architecture for Pomodoro App

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines a sophisticated, research-informed agentic LLM workflow to transform your Pomodoro application from a timer-focused tool into a comprehensive productivity system. By implementing hierarchical AI agents that collaborate to process users' goals and tasks across multiple time horizons, the system will deliver personalized planning, intelligent task breakdown, and adaptive learning—all while remaining intuitive for users.

## Core Architecture: Hierarchical Agent Collaboration

### Agent System Overview

The system employs a structured hierarchy of specialized AI agents, each responsible for a specific planning horizon or function:

| Agent Type | Primary Role | Input Sources | Output |
|------------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| **Strategy Agent** | Define 2-month strategic objectives | User goals, calendar events, previous completions | Strategic milestones with deadlines |
| **Week Agent** | Create weekly aligned objectives | Strategy output, calendar, task history | Prioritized weekly goals |
| **Day Agent** | Generate actionable daily goals | Weekly goals, task history, energy patterns | Daily goals with time estimates |
| **Task Agent** | Break down daily goals into Pomodoro tasks | Daily goals, past task breakdown data | Specific tasks with Pomodoro estimates |
| **Consistency Agent** | Ensure cross-timeframe alignment | Outputs from all agents | Consistency patches |
| **Feedback Agent** | Process completion data and user feedback | Session history, user feedback | Personalized adjustments |
| **Resource Agent** | Research and provide relevant knowledge | User goals, questions, reference libraries | Domain-specific insights |

### Data Flow and Processing Sequence

1. **Initial Context Acquisition**:
   - Process user's direct input (goals, projects, deadlines)
   - Analyze calendar data (meetings, events)
   - Reference historical task data (completion rates, patterns)
   - Integrate existing task details

2. **Sequential Processing Pipeline**:
   - Strategy Agent → Week Agent → Day Agent → Task Agent
   - Consistency Agent performs cross-checks after each stage
   - Feedback Agent enriches subsequent planning cycles

3. **Intelligent State Management**:
   - Maintain shared context between agents
   - Track dependencies between goals across time horizons
   - Preserve consistent terminology and references

## Task Breakdown System: Core Functionality

### Task Decomposition Process

The Task Agent breaks down goals into Pomodoro-sized chunks using this multi-stage approach:

1. **Complexity Analysis**:
   - Estimate conceptual complexity (simple → complex)
   - Evaluate technical requirements (none → specialized)
   - Assess creative demands (routine → highly creative)

2. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - Identify similar previously completed tasks
   - Apply learned time patterns from historical data
   - Consider user-specific velocity factors

3. **Context-Aware Chunking**:
   - Apply "natural chunking" to preserve cognitive flow
   - Identify logical stopping points within workflows
   - Ensure chunks are self-contained when possible

4. **Pomodoro Estimation Algorithm**:
   ```
   For each task:
     base_estimate = analyze_core_complexity(task)
     user_factor = calculate_user_velocity(task_type, user_history)
     context_modifier = assess_context_factors(time_of_day, adjacent_tasks)
     learning_curve = estimate_familiarity_factor(user, task_domain)
     
     final_estimate = base_estimate * user_factor * context_modifier / learning_curve
     
     Round to nearest whole Pomodoro
   ```

5. **Sequencing Optimization**:
   - Group related tasks to minimize context switching
   - Consider cognitive load patterns (difficult first vs. warmup tasks)
   - Adapt to user's known energy cycles (if data available)

### Task Representation Model

Tasks are structured with rich metadata:

```
Task {
  id: string,
  title: string,
  description: string,
  parent_goal: Goal,
  estimated_pomodoros: number,
  completed_pomodoros: number,
  domain_category: string,
  energy_demand: number (1-5),
  cognitive_type: ["analytical", "creative", "administrative", etc.],
  dependencies: [Task],
  notes: string,
  completion_status: boolean,
  historical_accuracy: number // ratio of estimated to actual
}
```

## User Interaction and Feedback Loop

### Interaction Touchpoints

1. **Initial Input Collection**:
   - Natural language goal descriptions
   - Calendar integration for time constraints
   - Optional domain specification (work, personal, etc.)

2. **Review and Refinement Interface**:
   - Interactive editing of agent-generated content in each tab
   - Suggestion acceptance/rejection with reasoning capture
   - Manual adjustment of time estimates

3. **Execution Feedback**:
   - Real-time task completion tracking
   - Mid-session notes and blockers
   - Post-session reflection prompts

4. **Periodic Reviews**:
   - Daily summary and planning refresh
   - Weekly review with pattern analysis
   - Monthly strategic recalibration

### Adaptive Learning Mechanisms

The system continuously improves through:

1. **User-Specific Pattern Detection**:
   - Task completion velocity by domain/type
   - Accuracy of time estimates across contexts
   - Productivity periods and optimal scheduling times

2. **Explicit Feedback Processing**:
   - Post-session micro-feedback (helpful/not helpful)
   - Qualitative comments on breakdowns
   - Planning horizon satisfaction ratings

3. **Implicit Signal Analysis**:
   - Task rescheduling patterns
   - Abandonment indicators
   - Modification frequency of estimates

4. **Calibration Logic**:
   ```
   For each task_type:
     historical_accuracy = avg(actual_time / estimated_time)
     if historical_accuracy consistently > 1.2:
       adjustment_factor = min(historical_accuracy, 1.5)
       apply_to_future_estimates(task_type, adjustment_factor)
     
     recalibrate_every(20 tasks)
   ```

## Domain-Specific Knowledge Integration

### Proxemics-Informed Design

Applying principles of proxemics (the study of personal space and interpersonal distance):

1. **Cognitive Proxemics**:
   - Respect mental space by gradually introducing suggestions
   - Allow clear boundaries between planning and execution modes
   - Create visual distinct "territories" for different time horizons

2. **Task Relationship Visualization**:
   - Map task relationships in spatial metaphors
   - Use proximity to indicate relatedness of tasks
   - Employ territorial markers for different domains/projects

3. **Interaction Design**:
   - Allow users to "invite" agent assistance rather than imposing it
   - Provide clear opt-in/opt-out mechanisms for suggestions
   - Maintain appropriate "distance" in communication tone

### Specialized Knowledge Bases

The system leverages specialized knowledge domains:

1. **Productivity Research**:
   - Task-switching cost awareness
   - Parkinson's Law countermeasures
   - Flow state optimization techniques

2. **Cognitive Psychology**:
   - Working memory limitations (7±2 items)
   - Attention restoration principles
   - Cognitive load management strategies

3. **Domain-Specific Task Patterns**:
   - Programming: planning, coding, testing, refactoring
   - Writing: research, drafting, editing, formatting
   - Learning: concept mapping, practice, recall, application
