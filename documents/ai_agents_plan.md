Workflow Overview
The goal is to create a system where LLMs assist users in generating, refining, and organizing content across the four tabs, which then directly inform the tasks users set for their Pomodoro sessions. The workflow involves:

User Input: Collecting initial context from the user.
LLM-Generated Suggestions: Producing tailored content for each tab.
User Review and Edit: Allowing the user to refine the suggestions.
Pomodoro Task Creation: Translating tab content into actionable Pomodoro tasks.
Feedback Loop: Tracking progress and refining future suggestions.
Periodic Review: Analyzing achievements and adjusting plans.
This ensures a dynamic, personalized planning process that enhances your app’s core Pomodoro functionality.

Step-by-Step Workflow
1. User Input
Purpose: Gather initial context to inform the content of the four tabs.
How It Works: The user enters a brief description of their current projects, priorities, or goals via a text box in the app (e.g., under a "Start Planning" section).
Example Input: "I need to work on my thesis this week. I also have a meeting with my advisor on Wednesday."
App Implementation:
Add a text input field labeled "Tell us about your goals or tasks."
Optional: Allow integration with external data (e.g., calendar events or task lists) to enrich the input.
LLM Role: Parse the natural language input to extract key tasks, deadlines, and priorities using basic NLP capabilities.
2. LLM-Generated Suggestions for Each Tab
The LLM (e.g., Ollama or Google Gemini) processes the user’s input and generates suggestions for each tab. Each tab has a unique purpose, requiring specific prompt engineering to guide the LLM’s output.

a. Today Goals
Purpose: Specific, actionable objectives to complete by the end of the day.
LLM Task: Break down the user’s input into 2–5 clear, measurable goals.
Output Format: A bullet-point list.
Prompt Example:
text

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
Based on the user’s input: "[input]", generate a list of 2–5 specific, actionable goals for today. Each goal should be concise and achievable within a day. Output as bullet points.
Example Output:
Outline Chapter 3 of the thesis.
Prepare questions for the advisor meeting.
App Display: Show as an editable list under the "Today Goals" tab.
b. Today High-Level Plan
Purpose: A broad outline of the day’s approach, including themes or time blocks.
LLM Task: Suggest a structured plan based on the Today Goals and user habits (if tracked).
Output Format: Bullet points or a short paragraph.
Prompt Example:
text

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
Using the user’s input: "[input]" and today’s goals, create a high-level plan for today. Include suggested time blocks or focus areas. Limit to 3–5 lines. Output as bullet points.
Example Output:
Morning: Focus on thesis outlining.
Afternoon: Prepare for the meeting and handle urgent emails.
App Display: Present as an editable text block under the "Today High-Level Plan" tab.
c. This Week Goals
Purpose: Broader objectives for the week, aligned with ongoing projects or deadlines.
LLM Task: Generate 3–7 goals that build on daily tasks and consider upcoming events.
Output Format: A bullet-point list.
Prompt Example:
text

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
Based on the user’s input: "[input]", generate a list of 3–7 specific goals for this week. Ensure they align with current projects and deadlines. Output as bullet points.
Example Output:
Complete the first draft of Chapter 3.
Have a productive meeting with the advisor and get feedback.
Start gathering resources for Chapter 4.
App Display: Show as an editable list under the "This Week Goals" tab.
d. Next 2 Months Strategy
Purpose: A long-term plan outlining major milestones or approaches for the next two months.
LLM Task: Propose a high-level strategy aligned with the user’s overall objectives.
Output Format: Bullet points or a concise paragraph.
Prompt Example:
text

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
Using the user’s input: "[input]" and weekly goals, outline a strategic plan for the next two months. Focus on 3–5 major milestones or approaches. Output as bullet points.
Example Output:
Finish drafting all chapters by the end of next month.
Schedule regular check-ins with the advisor.
Begin preparing for the defense presentation.
App Display: Present as an editable text block under the "Next 2 Months Strategy" tab.
3. User Review and Edit
Purpose: Ensure the user has control over the planning process.
How It Works: The app displays the LLM-generated suggestions in each tab, allowing the user to edit, add, or remove items.
App Implementation:
Use text fields or list editors for each tab.
Add a "Regenerate" button to request new suggestions if the user dislikes the initial output.
Include a "Save" button to finalize the content.
LLM Role: If the user edits significantly, the LLM can refine the content further upon request (e.g., "Refine my edited goals into a clearer list").
4. Pomodoro Task Creation
Purpose: Translate the finalized tab content into actionable Pomodoro tasks.
How It Works:
The app prioritizes Today Goals to generate tasks for immediate Pomodoro sessions.
Each goal is broken into smaller, 25-minute tasks, with estimated Pomodoro counts based on complexity or user history.
The Today High-Level Plan informs task sequencing (e.g., morning tasks first).
LLM Task: Suggest task breakdowns and time estimates.
Prompt Example:
text

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
For the goal: "[goal from Today Goals]", break it into smaller tasks suitable for 25-minute Pomodoro sessions. Estimate the number of Pomodoros needed. Output as a list with estimates.
Example:
Goal: "Outline Chapter 3 of the thesis."
Tasks:
Outline Section 3.1 (1 Pomodoro).
Outline Section 3.2 (1 Pomodoro).
Review outline (1 Pomodoro).
Total: 3 Pomodoros.
App Implementation:
Add a "Create Pomodoro Tasks" button in the "Today Goals" tab.
Display tasks in the existing task list (e.g., "Work Session - Outline Section 3.1 (0/1)").
Link to your app’s timer controls (Pause/Resume/Stop).
5. Feedback Loop and Progress Tracking
Purpose: Refine future suggestions based on user performance.
How It Works:
As the user completes Pomodoros, the app tracks progress (e.g., "Work Session - Outline Section 3.1 (1/1)").
Updates are reflected in the tabs (e.g., marking "Outline Chapter 3" as 2/3 complete).
LLM Role: Analyze completion data to adjust time estimates or suggest task adjustments.
App Implementation:
Use your existing task tracking (e.g., purple dots) to show progress.
Store completion data (e.g., time taken per task) for LLM personalization.
6. Periodic Review and Adjustment
Purpose: Reflect on progress and improve future planning.
How It Works:
At the end of the day, week, or month, the app prompts a review.
The LLM generates a summary and suggestions for adjustments.
Prompt Example:
text

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
Based on completed tasks: "[task data]" and goals: "[tab content]", generate a summary of achievements and 1–3 suggestions for next steps. Output as a short paragraph.
Example Output:
"You completed 2/3 Pomodoros for the thesis outline today. Consider allocating an extra Pomodoro tomorrow to finish it."
App Implementation:
Add a "Review" button in each tab.
Display the LLM’s summary in a pop-up or dedicated section.
Key Concepts and Implementation Details
a. Contextual Understanding
Concept: The LLM must align content across time frames (e.g., weekly goals support the two-month strategy).
Solution: Use a hierarchical prompt structure:
Generate Next 2 Months Strategy first.
Feed it into the prompt for This Week Goals, then Today Goals.
b. Personalization
Concept: Tailor suggestions to the user’s habits over time.
Solution: Store user data (e.g., average Pomodoros per task type) and include it in prompts (e.g., "User typically takes 2 Pomodoros for outlining").
c. Handling Vague Input
Concept: Users may give incomplete input (e.g., "Work on project").
Solution: Add a fallback prompt:
text

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
If the input: "[input]" is vague, ask 1–2 clarifying questions (e.g., ‘What part of the project?’) or assume common tasks (e.g., planning, execution).
d. Structured Output
Concept: Ensure LLM output is app-friendly.
Solution: Specify formats in prompts (e.g., "Output as bullet points") and parse responses into your app’s UI.
e. Privacy and Security
Concept: Protect user data (goals, tasks).
Solution: Use local LLM models (e.g., Ollama) or encrypt data if using cloud-based models (e.g., Gemini).
