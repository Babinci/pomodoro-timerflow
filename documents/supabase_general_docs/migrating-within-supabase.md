### Backup file from the dashboard (\*.backup) [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/migrating-within-supabase\#backup-file-from-the-dashboard-backup)

Follow the [Restore dashboard backup guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/migrating-within-supabase/dashboard-restore)

### SQL backup files (\*.sql) [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/migrating-within-supabase\#sql-backup-files-sql)

## Transfer project to a different organization [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/migrating-within-supabase\#transfer-project-to-a-different-organization)

Project migration is primarily for changing regions or upgrading to new major versions of the platform in some scenarios. If you need to move your project to a different organization without touching the infrastructure, see [project transfers](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/project-transfer).
