# Subscribing to Database Changes

## Listen to database changes in real-time from your website or application.

* * *

You can use Supabase to subscribe to real-time database changes. There are two options available:

1. [Broadcast](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/broadcast). This is the recommended method for scalability and security.
2. [Postgres Changes](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/postgres-changes). This is a simpler method. It requires less setup, but does not scale as well as Broadcast.

## Using Broadcast [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/subscribing-to-database-changes\#using-broadcast)

To automatically send messages when a record is created, updated, or deleted, we can attach a [Postgres trigger](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/triggers) to any table. Supabase Realtime provides a `realtime.broadcast_changes()` function which we can use in conjunction with a trigger.

### Broadcast authorization [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/subscribing-to-database-changes\#broadcast-authorization)

[Realtime Authorization](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/authorization) is required for receiving Broadcast messages. This is an example of a policy that allows authenticated users to listen to messages from topics:

```flex

create policy "Authenticated users can receive broadcasts"on "realtime"."messages"for selectto authenticatedusing ( true );
```

### Create a trigger function [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/subscribing-to-database-changes\#create-a-trigger-function)

Let's create a function that we can call any time a record is created, updated, or deleted. This function will make use of some of Postgres's native [trigger variables](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plpgsql-trigger.html#PLPGSQL-DML-TRIGGER). For this example, we want to have a topic with the name `topic:<record id>` to which we're going to broadcast events.

```

### Create a trigger [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/subscribing-to-database-changes\#create-a-trigger)

Let's set up a trigger so the function is executed after any changes to the table.

```flex

1
2
3
4
5
create trigger handle_your_table_changesafter insert or update or deleteon public.your_tablefor each rowexecute function your_table_changes ();
```

#### Listening on client side [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/subscribing-to-database-changes\#listening-on-client-side)

Finally, on the client side, listen to the topic `topic:<record_id>` to receive the events. Remember to set the channel as a private channel, since `realtime.broadcast_changes` uses Realtime Authorization.

```flex

1

const gameId = 'id'await supabase.realtime.setAuth() // Needed for Realtime Authorizationconst changes = supabase  .channel(`topic:${gameId}`, {    config: { private: true },  })  .on('broadcast', { event: 'INSERT' }, (payload) => console.log(payload))  .on('broadcast', { event: 'UPDATE' }, (payload) => console.log(payload))  .on('broadcast', { event: 'DELETE' }, (payload) => console.log(payload))  .subscribe()
```

## Using Postgres Changes [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/subscribing-to-database-changes\#using-postgres-changes)

Postgres Changes are simple to use, but have some [limitations](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/postgres-changes#limitations) as your application scales. We recommend using Broadcast for most use cases.

### Enable Postgres Changes [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/subscribing-to-database-changes\#enable-postgres-changes)

You'll first need to create a `supabase_realtime` publication and add your tables (that you want to subscribe to) to the publication:

```flex

1

begin;-- remove the supabase_realtime publicationdrop  publication if exists supabase_realtime;-- re-create the supabase_realtime publication with no tablescreate publication supabase_realtime;commit;-- add a table called 'messages' to the publication-- (update this to match your tables)alter  publication supabase_realtime add table messages;
```

### Streaming inserts [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/subscribing-to-database-changes\#streaming-inserts)

You can use the `INSERT` event to stream all new rows.

```flex

import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'const supabase = createClient(process.env.SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_KEY)const channel = supabase  .channel('schema-db-changes')  .on(    'postgres_changes',    {      event: 'INSERT',      schema: 'public',    },    (payload) => console.log(payload)  )  .subscribe()
```

### Streaming updates [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/subscribing-to-database-changes\#streaming-updates)

You can use the `UPDATE` event to stream all updated rows.

```flex

```
