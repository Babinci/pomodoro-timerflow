# How can I revoke execution of a PostgreSQL function?

All functions access is PUBLIC by default, this means that any role can execute it. To revoke execution, there are 2 steps required:

- Revoke function execution ( `foo` in this case) from PUBLIC:

```flex

1
revoke execute on function foo from public;
```

- Revoke execution from a particular role ( `anon` in this case):

```flex

1
revoke execute on function foo from anon;
```

Now `anon` should get an error when trying to execute the function:

```flex

1
2
3
4
begin;set local role anon;select foo();ERROR:  permission denied for function foo
```
