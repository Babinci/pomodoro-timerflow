# Broadcast

## Send low-latency messages using the client libs, REST, or your Database.

* * *

You can use Realtime Broadcast to send low-latency messages between users. Messages can be sent using the client libraries, REST APIs, or directly from your database.

## Subscribe to messages [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/broadcast\#subscribe-to-messages)

You can use the Supabase client libraries to receive Broadcast messages.

### Initialize the client [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/broadcast\#initialize-the-client)

Go to your Supabase project's [API Settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api) and grab the `URL` and `anon` public API key.

import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'const SUPABASE_URL = 'https://<project>.supabase.co'const SUPABASE_KEY = '<your-anon-key>'const supabase = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY)
```

### Receiving Broadcast messages [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/broadcast\#receiving-broadcast-messages)

You can provide a callback for the `broadcast` channel to receive message. This example will receive any `broadcast` messages that are sent to `test-channel`:

// Join a room/topic. Can be anything except for 'realtime'.const myChannel = supabase.channel('test-channel')// Simple function to log any messages we receivefunction messageReceived(payload) {  console.log(payload)}// Subscribe to the ChannelmyChannel  .on(    'broadcast',    { event: 'shout' }, // Listen for "shout". Can be "*" to listen to all events    (payload) => messageReceived(payload)  )  .subscribe()
```

## Send messages [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/broadcast\#send-messages)

### Broadcast using the client libraries [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/broadcast\#broadcast-using-the-client-libraries)

You can use the Supabase client libraries to send Broadcast messages.

const myChannel = supabase.channel('test-channel')/** * Sending a message before subscribing will use HTTP */myChannel  .send({    type: 'broadcast',    event: 'shout',    payload: { message: 'Hi' },  })  .then((resp) => console.log(resp))/** * Sending a message after subscribing will use Websockets */myChannel.subscribe((status) => {  if (status !== 'SUBSCRIBED') {    return null  }  myChannel.send({    type: 'broadcast',    event: 'shout',    payload: { message: 'Hi' },  })})
```

### Broadcast from the Database [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/broadcast\#broadcast-from-the-database)

This feature is in Public Alpha. [Submit a support ticket](https://supabase.help/) if you have any issues.

You can send messages directly from your database using the `realtime.send()` function:

```flex

select  realtime.send(    jsonb_build_object('hello', 'world'), -- JSONB Payload    'event', -- Event name    'topic', -- Topic    false -- Public / Private flag  );
```

It's a common use case to broadcast messages when a record is created, updated, or deleted. We provide a helper function specific to this use case, `realtime.broadcast_changes()`. For more details, check out the [Subscribing to Database Changes](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/subscribing-to-database-changes) guide.

### Broadcast using the REST API [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/broadcast\#broadcast-using-the-rest-api)

You can send a Broadcast message by making an HTTP request to Realtime servers.

```

## Broadcast options [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/broadcast\#broadcast-options)

You can pass configuration options while initializing the Supabase Client.

### Self-send messages [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/broadcast\#self-send-messages)

JavaScriptDartSwiftKotlinPython

By default, broadcast messages are only sent to other clients. You can broadcast messages back to the sender by setting Broadcast's `self` parameter to `true`.

```flex

const myChannel = supabase.channel('room-2', {  config: {    broadcast: { self: true },  },})myChannel.on(  'broadcast',  { event: 'test-my-messages' },  (payload) => console.log(payload))myChannel.subscribe((status) => {  if (status !== 'SUBSCRIBED') { return }  channelC.send({    type: 'broadcast',    event: 'test-my-messages',    payload: { message: 'talking to myself' },  })})
```

### Acknowledge messages [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/broadcast\#acknowledge-messages)

JavaScriptDartSwiftKotlinPython

You can confirm that the Realtime servers have received your message by setting Broadcast's `ack` config to `true`.

```flex

const myChannel = supabase.channel('room-3', {  config: {    broadcast: { ack: true },  },})myChannel.subscribe(async (status) => {  if (status !== 'SUBSCRIBED') { return }  const serverResponse = await myChannel.send({    type: 'broadcast',    event: 'acknowledge',    payload: {},  })  console.log('serverResponse', serverResponse)})
```

Use this to guarantee that the server has received the message before resolving `channelD.send`'s promise. If the `ack` config is not set to `true` when creating the channel, the promise returned by `channelD.send` will resolve immediately.
