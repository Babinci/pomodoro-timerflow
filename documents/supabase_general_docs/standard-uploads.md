# Standard Uploads

## Learn how to upload files to Supabase Storage.

## Uploading [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/uploads/standard-uploads\#uploading)

The standard file upload method is ideal for small files that are not larger than 6MB.

It uses the traditional `multipart/form-data` format and is simple to implement using the supabase-js SDK. Here's an example of how to upload a file using the standard upload method:

Though you can upload up to 5GB files using the standard upload method, we recommend using [TUS Resumable Upload](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/uploads/resumable-uploads) for uploading files greater than 6MB in size for better reliability.

```

## Overwriting files [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/uploads/standard-uploads\#overwriting-files)

When uploading a file to a path that already exists, the default behavior is to return a `400 Asset Already Exists` error.
If you want to overwrite a file on a specific path you can set the `upsert` options to `true` or using the `x-upsert` header.

// Create Supabase clientconst supabase = createClient('your_project_url', 'your_supabase_api_key')await supabase.storage.from('bucket_name').upload('file_path', file, {  upsert: true,})
```

We do advise against overwriting files when possible, as our Content Delivery Network will take sometime to propagate the changes to all the edge nodes leading to stale content.
Uploading a file to a new path is the recommended way to avoid propagation delays and stale content.

## Content type [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/uploads/standard-uploads\#content-type)

By default, Storage will assume the content type of an asset from the file extension. If you want to specify the content type for your asset, pass the `contentType` option during upload.

// Create Supabase clientconst supabase = createClient('your_project_url', 'your_supabase_api_key')await supabase.storage.from('bucket_name').upload('file_path', file, {  contentType: 'image/jpeg',})
```

## Concurrency [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/uploads/standard-uploads\#concurrency)

When two or more clients upload a file to the same path, the first client to complete the upload will succeed and the other clients will receive a `400 Asset Already Exists` error.
If you provide the `x-upsert` header the last client to complete the upload will succeed instead.
