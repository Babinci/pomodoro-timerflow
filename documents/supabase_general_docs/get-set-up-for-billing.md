# Get set up for billing

* * *

Correct billing settings are essential for ensuring successful payment processing and uninterrupted services. Additionally, it's important to configure all invoicing-related data early, as this information cannot be changed once an invoice is issued. Review these key points to ensure everything is set up correctly from the start.

### Ensuring valid credit card details [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/get-set-up-for-billing\#ensuring-valid-credit-card-details)

Paid plans require a credit card to be on file. Ensure the correct credit card is set as active and

- has not expired
- has sufficient funds
- has a sufficient transaction limit

For more information on managing payment methods, see [Manage your payment methods](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-subscription#manage-your-payment-methods).

### Alternatives to monthly charges [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/get-set-up-for-billing\#alternatives-to-monthly-charges)

Instead of having your credit card charged every month, you can make an upfront payment by topping up your credit balance.

You may want to consider this option to avoid issues with recurring payments, gain more control over how often your credit card is charged, and potentially make things easier for your accounting department.

For more information on credits and credit top-ups, see the [Credits page](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/credits).

## Billing details [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/get-set-up-for-billing\#billing-details)

Billing details cannot be changed once an invoice is issued, so it's crucial to configure them correctly from the start.

You can update your billing email address, billing address and tax ID on the [organization's billing page](https://supabase.com/dashboard/org/_/billing).
