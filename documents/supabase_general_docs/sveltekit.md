# Supabase Auth with SvelteKit

* * *

We generally recommend using the new `@supabase/ssr` package instead of `auth-helpers`. `@supabase/ssr` takes the core concepts of the Auth Helpers package and makes them available to any server framework. Check out the [migration doc](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/server-side/migrating-to-ssr-from-auth-helpers) to learn more.
