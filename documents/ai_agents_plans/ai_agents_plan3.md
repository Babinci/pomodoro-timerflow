### Refined Agentic LLM Workflow for Your Pomodoro App with Four New Tabs

You’re enhancing your existing Pomodoro app—which follows the traditional structure of 25-minute work sessions, 5-minute short breaks, and 15–30-minute long breaks after four Pomodoros, with task creation (e.g., "praca the house" with 3 Pomodoros), and controls like Pause, Resume, Stop, and Reset All Rounds—by adding four text tabs: **Today Goals**, **Today High-Level Plan**, **This Week Goals**, and **Next 2 Months Strategy**. These tabs will interact with LLMs (e.g., Ollama or Google Gemini) to support Pomodoro task creation, aiming for top-notch productivity support that prioritizes sophistication and ease of use, even if it runs slower under the hood. Below is a refined, detailed, and specific workflow that leverages agentic LLM cooperation to organize this system seamlessly within your app.

## Workflow Overview

This workflow integrates the new tabs into your Pomodoro app by using LLMs as collaborative agents to generate hierarchical plans, convert them into actionable tasks, and adapt based on user progress. It’s designed to be intuitive, user-centric, and deeply supportive of productivity. The key steps are:

1. **User Input**: Collect initial context to kickstart planning.
2. **Hierarchical Plan Generation**: Use LLMs to populate the four tabs with interconnected content.
3. **User Review and Customization**: Allow users to refine suggestions with LLM assistance.
4. **Pomodoro Task Creation**: Transform daily goals into tasks for your timer.
5. **Execution and Tracking**: Work on tasks using your app’s Pomodoro structure.
6. **Feedback and Review**: Adjust plans based on progress.

## Detailed Workflow

### 1. User Input
**Purpose**: Gather the foundation for personalized planning.  
**How It Works**:  
- Users provide a natural language description of their goals, projects, or deadlines in a text box.  
- **Example**: "I need to finish my thesis draft this week and prepare for a meeting with my advisor on Wednesday."  
**App Integration**:  
- Add a "Start Planning" section with a text field: *"Tell us about your goals or tasks."*  
- Optional: Include a toggle for calendar sync (e.g., *"Import events from calendar?"*) to pull in events like "Advisor Meeting - Wednesday 2 PM."  
- Submit via a *"Generate Plans"* button, triggering background LLM processing with a *"Planning…"* indicator.  
**LLM Role**:  
- Parse input to extract tasks (e.g., "thesis draft"), deadlines (e.g., "this week"), and events (e.g., "meeting Wednesday").  
- Handle vague inputs (e.g., "Work on project") by making reasonable assumptions (e.g., planning, execution tasks) or flagging for clarification later.

### 2. Hierarchical Plan Generation
**Purpose**: Create structured, aligned content for all four tabs using a top-down approach.  
**How It Works**:  
- Four specialized LLM agents collaborate sequentially:  
  - **Strategy Agent**: Sets the Next 2 Months Strategy.  
  - **Week Agent**: Defines This Week Goals based on the strategy.  
  - **Day Agent**: Creates Today Goals and Today High-Level Plan from weekly goals.  
  - **Consistency Agent**: Ensures coherence across tabs.  
- Each agent uses tailored prompts to generate specific outputs.  

#### a. Next 2 Months Strategy
**Purpose**: Outline long-term objectives to guide all planning.  
**LLM Prompt**:  
```
Using the user’s input: "[input]", outline a strategic plan for the next two months. Suggest 3–5 major milestones or focus areas. Output as bullet points.
```  
**Example Output**:  
- Complete thesis draft by end of next month.  
- Schedule bi-weekly advisor check-ins.  
- Start defense presentation prep by mid-next month.  
**App Display**: Editable bullet list in the "Next 2 Months Strategy" tab.

#### b. This Week Goals
**Purpose**: Define weekly objectives that support the long-term strategy.  
**LLM Prompt**:  
```
Based on the user’s input: "[input]" and Next 2 Months Strategy: "[strategy content]", generate 3–5 specific goals for this week. Ensure alignment with long-term milestones and deadlines. Output as bullet points.
```  
**Example Output**:  
- Finish Chapter 3 draft of the thesis.  
- Prepare for and attend advisor meeting.  
- Gather research for Chapter 4.  
**App Display**: Editable bullet list in the "This Week Goals" tab.

#### c. Today Goals
**Purpose**: Provide actionable daily goals.  
**LLM Prompt**:  
```
Using the user’s input: "[input]" and This Week Goals: "[week goals]", suggest 2–5 specific, achievable goals for today. Output as bullet points.
```  
**Example Output**:  
- Outline Chapter 3 of the thesis.  
- List questions for advisor meeting.  
**App Display**: Editable bullet list in the "Today Goals" tab.

#### d. Today High-Level Plan
**Purpose**: Offer a daily structure to guide focus.  
**LLM Prompt**:  
```
Based on the user’s input: "[input]" and Today Goals: "[today goals]", create a high-level plan for today with 2–4 time blocks or themes. Output as bullet points.
```  
**Example Output**:  
- Morning: Outline thesis chapter.  
- Afternoon: Prepare for advisor meeting.  
**App Display**: Editable bullet list in the "Today High-Level Plan" tab.

#### e. Consistency Check
**LLM Prompt**:  
```
Review content across tabs: "[all tab content]" and ensure alignment (e.g., Today Goals support This Week Goals). Suggest edits if inconsistent. Output as a list of suggestions.
```  
**Example**: "Add ‘Review Chapter 3 outline’ to Today Goals to align with weekly drafting goal."

---

### 3. User Review and Customization
**Purpose**: Empower users to refine LLM suggestions while maintaining coherence.  
**How It Works**:  
- Users edit tab content directly (e.g., add "Review last meeting notes" to Today Goals).  
- LLM refines edits on demand for clarity and alignment.  
**App Integration**:  
- **UI**:  
  - Lists for Today Goals and This Week Goals (add/delete/edit buttons).  
  - Text areas for Today High-Level Plan and Next 2 Months Strategy.  
- **Buttons**:  
  - *"Regenerate"* (re-runs LLM with original input).  
  - *"Refine"* (processes edits with LLM).  
  - *"Save"* (locks content).  
**LLM Prompt for Refine**:  
```
Take the user’s edited content: "[edited text]" and refine it into a clear, concise list or text matching the tab’s purpose. Output in the original format.
```  
**Example**: "Outline Chapter 3, add stuff" → "Outline Chapter 3" and "Add references to Chapter 3."

---

### 4. Pomodoro Task Creation
**Purpose**: Convert Today Goals into tasks for your Pomodoro timer.  
**How It Works**:  
- LLM breaks each Today Goal into 25-minute subtasks with Pomodoro estimates.  
- Today High-Level Plan suggests task order (e.g., morning tasks first).  
**LLM Prompt**:  
```
For the goal: "[goal from Today Goals]", break it into tasks for 25-minute Pomodoro sessions. Estimate Pomodoros based on complexity. Output as a list with estimates.
```  
**Example**:  
- Goal: "Outline Chapter 3 of the thesis."  
- Tasks:  
  - Outline Section 3.1 (1 Pomodoro).  
  - Outline Section 3.2 (1 Pomodoro).  
  - Review outline (1 Pomodoro).  
**App Integration**:  
- Add a *"Create Tasks"* button in the "Today Goals" tab.  
- Tasks populate your task list (e.g., "Outline Section 3.1 (0/1)") with purple dots for estimates.  
- Link to your timer: 25-minute sessions, 5-minute short breaks, 15–30-minute long breaks after 4 Pomodoros.

---

### 5. Execution and Tracking
**Purpose**: Work on tasks and monitor progress within your app’s structure.  
**How It Works**:  
- Users select tasks, start the 25-minute timer, and use Pause/Resume/Stop as needed.  
- Completed Pomodoros update task status (e.g., "Outline Section 3.1 (1/1)").  
**App Integration**:  
- Use your existing task list and timer controls.  
- Add a goal link to tasks (e.g., "Outline Section 3.1 - Chapter 3 Goal").  
- Track completed vs. estimated Pomodoros for personalization (stored locally).

---

### 6. Feedback and Review
**Purpose**: Reflect on progress and adapt plans.  
**How It Works**:  
- Daily, weekly, or monthly reviews summarize achievements and suggest updates.  
**LLM Prompt**:  
```
Based on completed tasks: "[task data]" and goals: "[tab content]", summarize progress and suggest 1–3 next steps. Output as a paragraph.
```  
**Example**:  
"You completed 2/3 Pomodoros for Chapter 3 outlining and prepared meeting questions. Add a Pomodoro tomorrow to finish the outline and review advisor feedback."  
**App Integration**:  
- Add *"Review Day"*, *"Review Week"*, and *"Review Month"* buttons in respective tabs.  
- Show summary in a pop-up with an *"Apply Updates"* button to adjust tabs.

## Technical Implementation

### LLM Integration
- **Ollama (Local)**: Run models on the user’s device (e.g., LLaMA). Requires sufficient CPU/GPU but ensures privacy.  
- **Gemini (Cloud)**: Use API calls for higher quality; encrypt data for security.  
- **Process**: Send prompts asynchronously, parse responses (e.g., JSON: `{"tasks": [{"name": "Outline", "pomodoros": 1}]}`), and update UI.

### UI Design
- **Tabs**: Add four tabs above your task list:  
  - Today Goals (list), Today High-Level Plan (text), This Week Goals (list), Next 2 Months Strategy (text).  
- **Buttons**: Generate Plans, Create Tasks, Review (per tab).  
- **Task List**: Extend with goal links (e.g., "Outline - Chapter 3 (0/1)").

### Data Storage
- **Local Storage**: Save tab content, tasks, and user history (e.g., JSON file).  
- **Example**:  
  ```json
  {
    "today_goals": ["Outline Chapter 3"],
    "tasks": [{"name": "Outline Section 3.1", "goal": "Outline Chapter 3", "estimated": 1, "completed": 0}]
  }
  ```
