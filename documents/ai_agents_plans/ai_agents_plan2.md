### Refined Agentic LLM Workflow for Your Pomodoro App with Four New Tabs

You’re developing a Pomodoro app that follows the traditional structure—25-minute work sessions, 5-minute short breaks after each Pomodoro, and a 15–30-minute long break after four Pomodoros—with features like task creation, Pomodoro estimation (e.g., 3 purple dots for "praca the house"), and session controls (Pause/Resume/Stop, Reset All Rounds). Now, you want to enhance it by adding four text tabs—**Today Goals**, **Today High-Level Plan**, **This Week Goals**, and **Next 2 Months Strategy**—that interact with LLMs (e.g., Ollama or Google Gemini) to support Pomodoro task creation. Your goal is top-notch productivity support, even if the system runs slower under the hood, with a sophisticated agentic workflow inspired by the provided system but refined for deeper user understanding and enhanced agentic cooperation.

Below is a detailed, specific, and comprehensive workflow that integrates these tabs into your app, leveraging LLMs to create a dynamic, personalized productivity assistant.

## Workflow Overview

The workflow uses LLMs as collaborative agents to generate, refine, and organize content across the four tabs, which then directly inform Pomodoro tasks. It’s designed to be hierarchical, adaptive, and user-centric, with the following steps:

1. **User Input**: Collect initial context from the user.
2. **Hierarchical LLM-Generated Suggestions**: Produce tailored, contextually aligned content for each tab.
3. **User Review and Edit**: Allow users to refine suggestions with LLM support.
4. **Pomodoro Task Creation**: Convert tab content into actionable tasks.
5. **Feedback Loop**: Track progress and adapt future suggestions.
6. **Periodic Review and Adjustment**: Reflect on achievements and update plans.

This system enhances your app’s core functionality by connecting planning across multiple time frames to execution via Pomodoro sessions.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. User Input
**Purpose**: Gather the foundation for planning across all tabs.  
**How It Works**:  
- The user enters a natural language description of their goals, projects, or priorities in a text box (e.g., under a "Start Planning" section in your app).  
- **Example Input**: "I need to work on my thesis this week. I also have a meeting with my advisor on Wednesday."  
**App Implementation**:  
- Add a text input field labeled: *"Tell us about your goals or tasks."*  
- Optional: Integrate with external sources (e.g., calendar events like "Advisor Meeting - Wednesday 2 PM") to enrich context. Include a toggle: *"Sync with Calendar?"*  
- Store the input locally for LLM processing.  
**LLM Role**:  
- Parse the input to identify tasks, deadlines, and priorities using basic NLP (e.g., extract "thesis" as a project, "Wednesday" as a deadline).  
- Handle vague input (e.g., "Work on project") by assuming common tasks (e.g., planning, execution) or prompting clarification (e.g., "What part of the project?").

### 2. Hierarchical LLM-Generated Suggestions for Each Tab
**Purpose**: Generate structured, interconnected content for the four tabs using a top-down approach to ensure alignment across time frames.  
**How It Works**:  
- Multiple LLM agents work collaboratively:  
  - **Strategy Agent**: Generates the Next 2 Months Strategy first.  
  - **Week Agent**: Uses the strategy to inform This Week Goals.  
  - **Day Agent**: Uses weekly goals to create Today Goals and Today High-Level Plan.  
- Each agent uses tailored prompts to produce specific outputs.  
**App Implementation**:  
- Process runs in the background after user input is submitted (e.g., via a "Generate Plans" button).  
- Display a loading indicator: *"Planning with LLM…"* since the system may work slower.

#### a. Next 2 Months Strategy
**Purpose**: Define a high-level, long-term plan with major milestones.  
**LLM Task**: Propose 3–5 strategic objectives based on user input.  
**Prompt**:  
```
Using the user’s input: "[input]", outline a strategic plan for the next two months. Focus on 3–5 major milestones or approaches aligned with the user’s goals. Output as bullet points.
```  
**Example Output**:  
- Finish drafting all thesis chapters by the end of next month.  
- Schedule regular check-ins with my advisor every two weeks.  
- Begin preparing the defense presentation by mid-next month.  
**App Display**: Editable text block under the "Next 2 Months Strategy" tab.

#### b. This Week Goals
**Purpose**: Set broader weekly objectives that support the long-term strategy.  
**LLM Task**: Generate 3–7 goals based on user input and the Next 2 Months Strategy.  
**Prompt**:  
```
Based on the user’s input: "[input]" and the Next 2 Months Strategy: "[strategy content]", generate a list of 3–7 specific goals for this week. Ensure alignment with long-term milestones and current deadlines. Output as bullet points.
```  
**Example Output**:  
- Complete the first draft of Chapter 3.  
- Have a productive meeting with my advisor and get feedback.  
- Start gathering resources for Chapter 4.  
**App Display**: Editable list under the "This Week Goals" tab.

#### c. Today Goals
**Purpose**: Create specific, actionable daily objectives.  
**LLM Task**: Break down user input and This Week Goals into 2–5 goals for today.  
**Prompt**:  
```
Using the user’s input: "[input]" and This Week Goals: "[week goals]", generate a list of 2–5 specific, actionable goals for today. Each goal should be concise and achievable within a day. Output as bullet points.
```  
**Example Output**:  
- Outline Chapter 3 of the thesis.  
- Prepare questions for the advisor meeting.  
**App Display**: Editable list under the "Today Goals" tab.

#### d. Today High-Level Plan
**Purpose**: Provide a broad daily structure to guide focus.  
**LLM Task**: Suggest a plan with time blocks or themes based on Today Goals.  
**Prompt**:  
```
Based on the user’s input: "[input]" and Today Goals: "[today goals]", create a high-level plan for today. Include 2–4 suggested time blocks or focus areas. Output as bullet points.
```  
**Example Output**:  
- Morning: Focus on thesis outlining.  
- Afternoon: Prepare for the advisor meeting and review notes.  
**App Display**: Editable text block under the "Today High-Level Plan" tab.

---

### 3. User Review and Edit
**Purpose**: Give users control over LLM suggestions while offering refinement support.  
**How It Works**:  
- Suggestions appear in each tab as editable fields.  
- Users can tweak content, add items, or remove suggestions.  
- **Example Edit**: Add "Review last meeting notes" to Today Goals.  
**App Implementation**:  
- Use list editors (e.g., bullet points with add/delete buttons) for Today Goals and This Week Goals.  
- Use text areas for Today High-Level Plan and Next 2 Months Strategy.  
- Add buttons:  
  - *"Regenerate"* (re-runs the LLM with original input).  
  - *"Refine"* (processes user edits with LLM for coherence).  
  - *"Save"* (finalizes content).  
**LLM Role**:  
- On "Refine," clean up edits:  
  **Prompt**:  
  ```
  Take the user’s edited content: "[edited text]" and refine it into a clear, concise list or paragraph matching the tab’s purpose. Output in the original format.
  ```  
- Example: Turn "Outline Chapter 3, add some stuff" into "Outline Chapter 3 of the thesis" and "Add references to Chapter 3."

---

### 4. Pomodoro Task Creation
**Purpose**: Transform Today Goals into actionable Pomodoro tasks for your app’s timer.  
**How It Works**:  
- The app prioritizes Today Goals to generate tasks.  
- Each goal is broken into 25-minute subtasks with estimated Pomodoro counts.  
- Today High-Level Plan informs task sequencing (e.g., morning tasks first).  
**LLM Task**: Suggest breakdowns and estimates.  
**Prompt**:  
```
For the goal: "[goal from Today Goals]", break it into smaller tasks suitable for 25-minute Pomodoro sessions. Estimate the number of Pomodoros needed based on complexity. Output as a list with estimates.
```  
**Example**:  
- Goal: "Outline Chapter 3 of the thesis."  
- Tasks:  
  - Outline Section 3.1 (1 Pomodoro).  
  - Outline Section 3.2 (1 Pomodoro).  
  - Review outline (1 Pomodoro).  
  - **Total**: 3 Pomodoros.  
**App Implementation**:  
- Add a *"Create Pomodoro Tasks"* button in the "Today Goals" tab.  
- Populate your task list (e.g., "Work Session - Outline Section 3.1 (0/1)") with these tasks.  
- Link tasks to your timer controls (25-minute sessions, Pause/Resume/Stop).  
- Update your purple dot system to reflect estimates (e.g., 3 dots for 3 Pomodoros).

---

### 5. Feedback Loop and Progress Tracking
**Purpose**: Adapt suggestions based on user performance.  
**How It Works**:  
- As users complete Pomodoros, the app tracks progress (e.g., "Outline Section 3.1 (1/1)").  
- Updates sync to the tabs (e.g., "Outline Chapter 3" marked as 2/3 complete).  
- Data personalizes future LLM suggestions.  
**App Implementation**:  
- Use your existing tracking (e.g., "Work Session - praca the house (0/3)") to log completions.  
- Store data locally: task name, estimated vs. actual Pomodoros, completion time.  
- Reflect progress in tabs with visual cues (e.g., checkmarks or progress bars).  
**LLM Role**:  
- Adjust estimates:  
  **Prompt**:  
  ```
  Given user data: "[task: Outline, estimated: 1, actual: 2]", update future Pomodoro estimates for similar tasks.
  ```  
- Example: If "Outline" tasks consistently take 2 Pomodoros, suggest 2 next time.

---

### 6. Periodic Review and Adjustment
**Purpose**: Reflect on progress and refine plans.  
**How It Works**:  
- Trigger reviews daily (end of day), weekly, or monthly via prompts (e.g., "Review Today’s Progress?").  
- LLM summarizes achievements and suggests next steps.  
**Prompt**:  
```
Based on completed tasks: "[task data]" and goals: "[tab content]", generate a summary of achievements and 1–3 suggestions for next steps. Output as a short paragraph.
```  
**Example Output**:  
"You completed 2/3 Pomodoros for the thesis outline today and prepared advisor questions. Consider allocating an extra Pomodoro tomorrow to finish the outline and review feedback post-meeting."  
**App Implementation**:  
- Add a *"Review"* button in each tab.  
- Show the summary in a pop-up with an *"Apply Suggestions"* option to update tabs.

## Key Concepts and Implementation Details

### a. Hierarchical Contextual Understanding
- **Concept**: Plans must align across time frames (e.g., daily tasks support weekly goals).  
- **Solution**: Chain LLM prompts hierarchically: Strategy → Week → Day. Feed prior outputs into subsequent prompts to maintain context.  
- **Implementation**: Store intermediate outputs (e.g., Strategy content) locally and append to prompts.

### b. Sophisticated Agentic Cooperation
- **Concept**: Multiple LLM agents collaborate for a cohesive workflow.  
- **Agents**:  
  - **Strategy Agent**: Long-term planning.  
  - **Week Agent**: Mid-term goals.  
  - **Day Agent**: Daily tasks and plans.  
  - **Feedback Agent**: Progress analysis and adjustments.  
- **Solution**: Each agent runs sequentially, passing outputs to the next. Use a coordinator script to manage calls (e.g., "After Strategy Agent, run Week Agent with Strategy output").  
- **Enhancement**: Add a **Consistency Agent** to check alignment across tabs:  
  **Prompt**:  
  ```
  Review content across tabs: "[all tab content]" and ensure consistency (e.g., daily goals support weekly goals). Suggest edits if misaligned.
  ```

### c. Deep User Understanding and Personalization
- **Concept**: Adapt to user habits and preferences over time.  
- **Solution**:  
  - Track data: Pomodoros per task type (e.g., "writing" = 2 Pomodoros), preferred work times (e.g., morning).  
  - Include in prompts: "User typically takes 2 Pomodoros for outlining; adjust estimates accordingly."  
- **Implementation**: Create a user profile database (e.g., JSON file) updated after each session.

### d. Handling Diverse Inputs
- **Concept**: Manage vague or detailed inputs effectively.  
- **Solution**:  
  - For vague input (e.g., "Work on thesis"): Assume tasks (e.g., "Research," "Write") and offer a *"Clarify"* button to ask questions (e.g., "Which chapter?").  
  - For detailed input: Extract specifics with NLP (e.g., "Wednesday" → deadline).  
- **Prompt**:  
  ```
  If input: "[input]" lacks detail, generate reasonable tasks and note assumptions. Output as bullet points with a clarification question.
  ```

### e. Structured Output for App Integration
- **Concept**: Ensure LLM responses fit your UI.  
- **Solution**:  
  - Specify formats in prompts (e.g., "bullet points," "3–5 items").  
  - Post-process outputs (e.g., parse into JSON: `{"goals": ["task1", "task2"]}`).  
- **Implementation**: Design tab UIs with list views and text areas that map to these formats.

### f. Privacy and Performance
- **Privacy**: Use local LLMs (e.g., Ollama) or encrypt data for cloud models (e.g., Gemini). Store user data locally with opt-in syncing.  
- **Performance**: Since speed is secondary to quality, batch LLM calls (e.g., generate all tabs at once) and cache results for quick edits. Use lighter models for simpler tasks (e.g., refinement).

- **Next 2 Months Strategy**:  
  - Finish drafting all chapters by next month.  
  - Schedule regular advisor check-ins.  
  - Begin defense prep by mid-next month.  
- **This Week Goals**:  
  - Complete Chapter 3 draft.  
  - Get advisor feedback in meeting.  
  - Gather Chapter 4 resources.  
- **Today Goals**:  
  - Outline Chapter 3.  
  - Prepare advisor questions.  
- **Today High-Level Plan**:  
  - Morning: Thesis outlining.  
  - Afternoon: Meeting prep.  
**Pomodoro Tasks**:  
- Outline Section 3.1 (1 Pomodoro).  
- Outline Section 3.2 (1 Pomodoro).  
- List advisor questions (1 Pomodoro).  
**Progress**: After 2 Pomodoros, task list shows "Work Session - Thesis Outline (2/3)."  
**Review**: "You’re 2/3 done with the outline. Add a Pomodoro tomorrow to finish."

---

## Integration with Your App’s Structure
- **Timer**: Tasks link to your 25-minute timer, with "Short" (5 min) and "Long" (15–30 min) breaks triggered as usual.  
- **Task List**: LLM tasks populate your list (e.g., "praca the house" → "Outline Section 3.1"), using purple dots for estimates.  
- **Controls**: "Pause/Resume/Stop" manage active sessions; "Reset All Rounds" restarts planning with a prompt: *"Update your goals?"*  
- **UI**: Add tabs above the task list, with buttons for Generate/Review/Create Tasks.
