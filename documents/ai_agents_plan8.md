Below is a detailed workflow that transforms your "Biomimetic Swarm Intelligence for Pomodoro Productivity Evolution" plan into a system of small 1.5B parameter agents. Each agent class from your plan is defined with a specific role, prompt, and potential finetuning data to bring this decentralized, adaptive ecosystem to life. This workflow outlines how these agents collaborate to process user input, manage tasks, and evolve over time, all while staying true to the biomimetic and quantum-inspired principles of your vision.

## Workflow Overview

The workflow operates as a decentralized swarm of micro-agents, each with a specialized function inspired by natural systems. These agents interact through a shared knowledge base (e.g., a dynamic data structure or blackboard system) and adapt via evolutionary mechanisms like genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning. The process begins with user input and cycles through task discovery, structuring, scheduling, execution, and continuous adaptation.

Here’s how it works step-by-step, followed by detailed agent definitions:

1. **User Input**: The user provides context or goals (e.g., "Finish a report by Friday and brainstorm project ideas").
2. **Agent Activation**: Relevant agents activate based on the input and current system state.
3. **Task Processing**: Agents process the input, generating, refining, and organizing tasks.
4. **Workflow Generation**: A cohesive workflow emerges from agent collaboration.
5. **User Interaction**: The user reviews, adjusts, and executes the workflow, providing feedback.
6. **Adaptation**: Agents learn from outcomes and evolve their strategies.

Now, let’s define the agents, their prompts, and finetuning data.

## Agent Definitions

Each agent is a 1.5B parameter model designed for efficiency and specialization. They communicate indirectly through the shared knowledge base, mimicking natural swarm dynamics like pheromone trails or stigmergy.

### 1. Forager Agents
- **Natural Inspiration**: Ant/Bee Scouts
- **Functional Role**: Discover and assess potential tasks
- **Adaptive Mechanism**: Pheromone trailing & dance communication

- **Finetuning Data**: 
  - User inputs (e.g., goals, notes) paired with tasks they eventually pursued.
  - Contextual data (time of day, location) linked to task engagement.
  - Historical task completion rates and user satisfaction scores.
- **Workflow Role**: Scans input like “Finish a report” and suggests tasks (e.g., “Draft outline,” “Research stats”) with initial probabilities.

### 2. Architect Agents
- **Natural Inspiration**: Termite Builders
- **Functional Role**: Structure workflow patterns
- **Adaptive Mechanism**: Stigmergy (environment-mediated coordination)
- **Prompt**: "Take a set of tasks from the shared knowledge base and organize them into a workflow that optimizes productivity. Minimize context switching and align with user preferences for task sequencing."
- **Finetuning Data**: 
  - Successful workflow examples from users (e.g., task sequences with high completion rates).
  - User feedback on workflow coherence and ease of execution.
  - Data on task dependencies and optimal orderings from project management tools.
- **Workflow Role**: Arranges tasks like “Draft outline” and “Research stats” into a logical sequence, e.g., research first, then drafting.

### 3. Guardian Agents
- **Natural Inspiration**: Immune System
- **Functional Role**: Identify and correct inefficiencies
- **Adaptive Mechanism**: Antigenic recognition & memory cells
- **Prompt**: "Monitor the user’s progress and system performance. Detect inefficiencies (e.g., procrastination, distractions) and suggest interventions like breaks or task reordering."
- **Finetuning Data**: 
  - Logs of user activity with timestamps of deviations (e.g., switching to social media).
  - Contextual triggers (e.g., notifications) linked to productivity drops.
  - Successful intervention examples (e.g., break prompts that restored focus).
- **Workflow Role**: Notices the user stalling on “Research stats” and suggests a 5-minute break.

### 4. Incubator Agents
- **Natural Inspiration**: Chrysalis Formation
- **Functional Role**: Transform vague ideas into concrete tasks
- **Adaptive Mechanism**: Metamorphic restructuring
- **Prompt**: "Break down a vague goal or idea from the shared knowledge base into specific, actionable tasks. Explore multiple decomposition approaches and anticipate obstacles."
- **Finetuning Data**: 
  - High-level goals (e.g., “Brainstorm project ideas”) mapped to detailed task lists.
  - Crowdsourced examples from productivity platforms (e.g., Trello, Notion).
  - User refinements to task breakdowns over time.
- **Workflow Role**: Converts “Brainstorm project ideas” into tasks like “List 10 ideas,” “Evaluate feasibility,” and “Pick top 3.”

### 5. Symbiotic Agents
- **Natural Inspiration**: Gut Microbiome
- **Functional Role**: Collaborate with user’s thinking style
- **Adaptive Mechanism**: Mutual adaptation mechanisms
- **Prompt**: "Customize the presentation of tasks and workflows based on the user’s cognitive preferences (e.g., visual, detailed, high-level). Adapt to feedback and interaction patterns."
- **Finetuning Data**: 
  - User interaction logs (e.g., clicks on visual timelines vs. text lists).
  - Explicit feedback on task presentation (e.g., “Too detailed”).
  - Profiles of user preferences from personality or productivity assessments.
- **Workflow Role**: Presents the report workflow as a visual timeline for a user who prefers graphics.

### 6. Circadian Agents
- **Natural Inspiration**: Biological Clock
- **Functional Role**: Optimize energy-task matching
- **Adaptive Mechanism**: Zeitgeber entrainment
- **Prompt**: "Schedule tasks from the shared knowledge base to align with the user’s energy patterns. Use biometric data or historical performance to match task difficulty with peak focus times."
- **Finetuning Data**: 
  - Time-stamped energy levels (e.g., from wearables or self-reports).
  - Task performance metrics by time of day (e.g., faster writing at 10 AM).
  - Chronotype data (e.g., morning vs. evening preferences).
- **Workflow Role**: Schedules “Research stats” for 10 AM when the user is most alert.

### 7. Dreamweaver Agents
- **Natural Inspiration**: REM Sleep Patterns
- **Functional Role**: Creative connection-making
- **Adaptive Mechanism**: Neural replay & consolidation
- **Prompt**: "Identify connections between tasks or ideas in the shared knowledge base. Suggest creative solutions or perspectives, drawing from diffuse thinking and past insights."
- **Finetuning Data**: 
  - Examples of creative outcomes (e.g., combining report research with project ideas).
  - User-reported “aha” moments or brainstorming session outputs.
  - Innovation datasets linking disparate concepts.
- **Workflow Role**: Suggests using report research to spark project ideas, enhancing both tasks.

## Workflow in Action

Here’s how the agents collaborate for a sample input: “Finish a report by Friday and brainstorm project ideas.”

1. **User Input**: Entered into the shared knowledge base.
2. **Forager Agents**: Identify tasks:
   - “Draft report outline” (70% probability).
   - “Research report data” (80%).
   - “List project ideas” (60%).
3. **Incubator Agents**: Refine vague goals:
   - “Brainstorm project ideas” → “List 10 ideas,” “Evaluate feasibility.”
4. **Architect Agents**: Structure the workflow:
   - Day 1: Research report data → Draft outline.
   - Day 2: List 10 ideas → Evaluate feasibility.
5. **Circadian Agents**: Schedule:
   - Research at 10 AM (peak energy).
   - Brainstorming at 3 PM (creative slump recovery).
6. **Symbiotic Agents**: Present as a visual timeline for the user.
7. **Dreamweaver Agents**: Suggest linking report data to project ideas.
8. **Guardian Agents**: Detect procrastination on research and prompt a break.
9. **Execution & Feedback**: User completes tasks, rates satisfaction, and adjusts the plan.
10. **Adaptation**: Agents update probabilities and strategies (e.g., Foragers increase weight on research tasks).

## Technical Implementation Notes

- **Shared Knowledge Base**: A dynamic structure (e.g., JSON or graph database) storing tasks, probabilities, user context, and agent outputs.
- **Agent Communication**: Agents read/write to the knowledge base asynchronously, simulating decentralized coordination.
- **Evolutionary Learning**: Genetic algorithms tweak agent parameters (e.g., prompt weights) based on fitness metrics like task completion rates.
- **Efficiency**: 1.5B parameter models use distilled architectures (e.g., from larger LLMs) to run on typical hardware.
- **Quantum-Inspired Features**: Tasks maintain probability distributions (e.g., 70% “Draft outline”) updated by user actions, mimicking superposition.
