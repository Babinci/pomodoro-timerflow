# Progress
actual plans:

timer problems:
- after long round- there is short break - it should be break from long preset- and i cant change break to long
- after 1 round and 1 break- i saw "start break" button instead of "start"
- when working in round and clicking pause- cant resume- screen "freezed"
- it is very hard to change ot long intervals
- after 25 short work- i see 10 min short break (it should be 5 min as short in settings)- and cant change during break to short break


- websockets server and client usage optimization
- problems with pause time- after long work i can see short break and cant change to long
- mess with timer
- after finished session i cant see  it in counter number

- optional bell ring at end of round
+ google auth
