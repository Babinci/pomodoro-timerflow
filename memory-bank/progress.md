# Progress
   - What works:
   web app and backend server live with docker, there is user crud, timer with settings

actual plans:

timer problems (current status- implemented changes of those now testing):
- after long round- there is short break - it should be break from long preset- and i cant change break to long
- after 1 round and 1 break- i saw "start break" button instead of "start"
- when working in round and clicking pause- cant resume- screen "freezed"
- it is very hard to change ot long intervals
- after 25 short work- i see 10 min short break (it should be 5 min as short in settings)- and cant change during break to short break



new problems:
- when i clicked new browser tab- it reseted to that new- first was counting 49 and then i opened new tab and it was 25 in second and reseted
    - generally, this timer should work even if i close browser so it should have universal source in websockets backend server and so timer should go to break/ end of break and have state, the only thing is that maybe each 5.am local time- it should reset as for new date (with some clever resources management in timer algorithm)

bus:
- Failed to update task: Failed to update task with increasing number of pomodoros
- server disconnecting problem

- What's left to build
- timers tests

- description field with more options for text formatting like tabs and bold font
- websockets server and client usage optimization
- problems with pause time- after long work i can see short break and cant change to long
- mess with timer
- after finished session i cant see  it in counter number
- confetti after finished task

- optional bell ring at end of round
+ google auth
