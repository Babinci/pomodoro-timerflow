# Progress

## What Works

-   Web app + backend Docker deployment
-   User CRUD operations
-   Basic timer functionality with settings
-   WebSocket connection establishment
-   Task creation/editing basics

## Strategic Roadmap

1.  **Database Migration to Supabase** (HIGH PRIORITY - Current Focus)
    -   Install Supabase locally
    -   Create MCP server for Supabase interaction
    -   Migrate data schema, auth, and websockets

2.  **Enhanced Planning Features** (MEDIUM PRIORITY - Q2 2025)
    -   Add text tabs for detailed planning
    -   Implement history storage for training data

3.  **State Management Optimization** (MEDIUM PRIORITY - Q2 2025)
    -   Improve timer reliability with Supabase
    -   Add comprehensive tests
    -   Performance optimizations

4.  **Wear OS App Development** (MEDIUM PRIORITY - Q3 2025)
    -   Complete build setup
    -   Implement core timer functionality
    -   Add task synchronization

5.  **AI Agent Integration** (LOW PRIORITY - Q4 2025)
    -   Implement Gemini integration
    -   Explore premium API models
    -   Collect data for fine-tuning

6.  **Business Strategy Development** (LOW PRIORITY - Q1 2026)
    -   User testing and feedback collection
    -   Marketing strategy
    -   Monetization planning

## What's Left to Build (Prioritized)

-   **HIGH:** Supabase database integration
-   **HIGH:** Connection persistence mechanism
-   **MEDIUM:** Wear OS app core functionality
-   **MEDIUM:** Advanced task description formatting
-   **MEDIUM:** WebSocket optimization
-   **LOW:** Confetti celebration system
-   **LOW:** Google Auth integration
-   **LOW:** Session history visualization

## Current Status

-   Timer connection bugs resolved (testing phase)
-   Drag-and-drop implementation complete (needs debugging)
-   Wear OS app setup in progress (Android Studio configuration)
-   **Supabase documentation has been reorganized with a table of contents and links to specific documentation files for improved organization and reduced redundancy.**

## Known Issues & Solutions

-   **Intermittent server disconnections after inactivity**
    -   *Solution:* Implement checkpoint states and connection keep-alive mechanism
    -   *Status:* In progress

-   **UI freezes when pausing/resuming sessions**
    -   *Solution:* Optimize state updates to prevent UI thread blocking
    -   *Status:* To be addressed after Supabase migration

-   **Preset transition inconsistencies**
    -   *Solution:* Refactor timer state management with improved validation
    -   *Status:* Planned for Q2 2025
    -   *Details:*
        -   Incorrect break durations after long sessions
        -   Difficulty changing to long intervals

-   **State synchronization problems**
    -   *Solution:* Implement server-authoritative state with Supabase real-time
    -   *Status:* Part of Supabase migration
    -   *Details:*
        -   Browser tab conflicts resetting timer
        -   Round counters not updating consistently
-   **Task update errors**
    -   *Solution:* Add transaction support and error handling
    -   *Status:* To be addressed with Supabase migration
    -   *Details:* "Failed to update task: pomodoro count increment failure"
