# Progress
actual plans:

problems:
- after long round- there is short break - it should be break from long preset- and i cant change break to long
- after 1 round and 1 break- i saw "start break" button instead of "start"


- websockets server and client usage optimization
- problems with pause time- after long work i can see short break and cant change to long
- mess with timer
- after finished session i cant see  it in counter number

- optional bell ring at end of round
