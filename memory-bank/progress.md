## Known Issues & Solutions

-   **Supabase permission errors** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
    -   *Solution:* Configured Row Level Security policies for all tables
    -   *Status:* Completed and verified working
    -   *Details:* All database tables now have proper RLS policies that allow users to access only their own data

-   **API Token security** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
    -   *Solution:* Updated tokens and implemented proper environment variable management
    -   *Status:* Completed with Docker environment variables and .env support
    -   *Details:* Created both ANON_KEY and SERVICE_ROLE_KEY support with proper diagnostic tools

-   **SQLAlchemy dependencies in existing code** ‚è© IN PROGRESS
    -   *Solution:* Creating clean implementations that don't rely on SQLAlchemy
    -   *Status:* Authentication and user management complete, others in progress
    -   *Details:* Current workaround uses in-memory SQLite for compatibility, but new endpoints use Supabase directly

-   **Intermittent server disconnections after inactivity**
    -   *Solution:* Implement checkpoint states and connection keep-alive mechanism
    -   *Status:* Will be addressed with Supabase implementation
    -   *Details:* Design completed, implementation pending

-   **UI freezes when pausing/resuming sessions**
    -   *Solution:* Optimize state updates to prevent UI thread blocking
    -   *Status:* To be addressed after Supabase migration
    -   *Details:* Will leverage Supabase's optimized state management

-   **Preset transition inconsistencies**
    -   *Solution:* Refactor timer state management with improved validation
