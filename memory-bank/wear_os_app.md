what i want from app?
- displaying actual task


why i need it?
i want to see actual task on watch not with browser

react-native-wear-connectivity as technology


i will test on samsung galaxy smartwatch 4


some proposed solution

Smartwatch App for Pomodoro Timer Brainstorming
Looking at your existing Pomodoro timer setup and the desire to extend it to a smartwatch, I can see this would be a valuable addition to your cross-platform system. Let me outline a potential solution using react-native-wear-connectivity.

Architecture Overview
The smartwatch app would be a simplified version of your main app, with focus on:

Authentication
Timer display and control
Task viewing
UI Design
Three Tab Layout
Main Timer Tab
Large timer display (00:00)
Task name in prominent position
Round number (smaller text, e.g. "Round 2/4")
Start/Stop button (prominent, color-coded)
Controls Tab
Timer still visible but smaller
Skip button (to next session)
Reset round button
Preset toggle (short/long)
Sync status indicator
Task Details Tab
Task description (scrollable if needed)
Estimated/completed pomodoros
Progress visualization
Technical Implementation
Authentication
Simplified login screen with option to scan QR code from main app
Store token securely and refresh as needed
Auto-login where possible
Connectivity
Use react-native-wear-connectivity for phone-watch communication
WebSocket connection for server communication (could be proxied through phone)
Fallback to local timer if connection lost
State Management
javascript

Copy
// Timer state management would mirror your existing approach
const [timeLeft, setTimeLeft] = useState(25 * 60);
const [isRunning, setIsRunning] = useState(false);
const [sessionType, setSessionType] = useState('work');
const [roundNumber, setRoundNumber] = useState(1);
Data Synchronization
Leverage your existing WebSocket protocol for timer state
Minimize data transfer to conserve battery
Implement a heartbeat system for maintaining connection
User Experience Considerations
Haptic feedback when timer completes
Simple gestures for common actions
High contrast UI elements
Battery efficient animation
Development Approach
Create a separate React Native project for Wear OS
Reuse components and logic from your existing web app
Implement the WebSocket connectivity similar to your current implementation
Create a minimal, focused UI for the small screen
Test extensively for battery consumption and reliability
Would you like me to explore any specific aspect of this solution in more detail?
