### Key Dependencies & Critical Path

1. The Supabase migration (Milestone 1) is the foundation for all other work and should be prioritized
2. Web app enhancements (Milestone 2) can begin in parallel with later stages of Supabase migration
3. Mobile/wearable development (Milestones 3-4) depends on core Supabase sync functionality
4. AI integration (Milestone 5) requires the data collection infrastructure from earlier milestones
5. Cross-platform integration (Milestone 8) depends on completion of individual platform development

### Resource Allocation Recommendation

- **Backend Development**: Focus initially on Supabase migration and core API endpoints
- **Frontend Development**: Prioritize web app initially, then expand to mobile platforms
- **AI Development**: Begin MCP server setup early but focus implementation after core platforms are stable
- **Design**: Work across all platforms to ensure consistent experience

This milestone plan creates a structured path from technical foundation to launch-ready product with standout premium features that justify monetization.
