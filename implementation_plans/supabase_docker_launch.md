# Supabase Integration: Docker Launch Process

## Implementation Summary

This document details the process of migrating the Pomodoro TimerFlow application's Docker setup from SQLite to Supabase. The migration involved several technical challenges and required multiple iterations to reach a working state.

### Initial Approach

The initial approach involved directly updating the Dockerfile to use the Supabase-specific files and dependencies while attempting to maintain compatibility with the existing codebase. This approach encountered several challenges:

1. **Dependency Conflicts**: The original requirements.txt file had version specifications that conflicted with Supabase's requirements, particularly with `httpx` and related packages.

2. **SQLAlchemy Dependencies**: Many of the application modules still depended on SQLAlchemy and attempted to initialize the database upon import, causing errors when these modules were imported in the Supabase version.

3. **Circular Imports**: Attempts to create compatibility layers between the SQLAlchemy and Supabase systems resulted in circular import issues and initialization errors.

### Execution Process

The Docker implementation process went through several iterations:

1. **Initial Requirements Update**: Created a specialized `requirements_supabase.txt` file that included Supabase client dependencies alongside the existing requirements.

2. **Version Conflict Resolution**: Encountered version conflicts between Supabase's required package versions and those in the existing application. Resolved by adjusting version constraints to be more flexible.

3. **SQLite Dependency Resolution**: Although we're migrating to Supabase, many modules still depended on SQLAlchemy. Added SQLAlchemy as a compatibility dependency.

4. **Entry Point Isolation**: Created a clean entry point (`main_clean.py`) that initializes only the necessary components without importing problematic SQLAlchemy-dependent modules.

5. **Container Configuration**: Modified the Dockerfile to use the clean implementation and updated the CMD to point to the new entry point.

### Challenges Encountered

During the implementation, several significant challenges were encountered:

1. **SQLAlchemy Initialization Errors**: The original modules attempted to initialize SQLAlchemy models and create tables upon import, leading to database connection errors even when those modules weren't being used directly.

2. **WebSocket Manager Dependencies**: The WebSocket manager had deep dependencies on SQLAlchemy Session objects and models, making it difficult to isolate from the database layer.

3. **In-Memory Database Issues**: Attempts to use an in-memory SQLite database as a compatibility layer failed due to file access permission issues in the Docker container.

4. **Supabase Permission Errors**: After successfully launching the container, encountered permission errors when attempting to access Supabase tables, indicating missing Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

### Current Status

The implementation has reached a minimally viable state:

- The Docker container builds successfully
- The application starts and serves the health check endpoint
- The container can serve static frontend files
- The connection to Supabase is established, though permission issues exist

The health check returns a permission error when trying to access Supabase tables, but the application itself is running correctly, allowing for further development of the Supabase integration.

## Next Steps Checklist

To complete the Supabase integration in Docker, the following steps need to be implemented:

- [ ] **Supabase Permission Configuration**
  - [ ] Configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all tables
  - [ ] Set up appropriate roles and access control
  - [ ] Update the Supabase URL and key to use proper credentials

- [ ] **API Implementation**
  - [ ] Implement user authentication endpoints
  - [ ] Implement task management endpoints
  - [ ] Implement Pomodoro session endpoints
  - [ ] Add proper error handling and status reporting

- [ ] **WebSocket Implementation**
  - [ ] Create a pure Supabase implementation of the WebSocket manager
  - [ ] Implement real-time synchronization through Supabase's realtime features
  - [ ] Add Supabase-based session state management

- [ ] **Environment Configuration**
  - [ ] Set up proper environment variable handling
  - [ ] Configure secrets management
  - [ ] Implement separate development/production configurations

- [ ] **Testing**
  - [ ] Test user authentication and authorization
  - [ ] Test task management functionality
  - [ ] Test Pomodoro timer functionality
  - [ ] Test WebSocket communication

- [ ] **Documentation**
  - [ ] Update application documentation with Supabase details
  - [ ] Create deployment instructions
  - [ ] Document environment variables and configuration options

## Technical Details

### Docker Configuration

The updated Dockerfile now uses a two-stage build process:

1. **Frontend Build Stage**: 
   - Uses Node.js to build the React frontend
   - Creates optimized static files for the frontend

2. **Backend Service Stage**:
   - Uses Python 3.9
   - Installs Supabase and compatibility dependencies
   - Copies backend code and frontend build
   - Uses the clean FastAPI implementation

### Key Files Created/Modified

1. **`requirements_supabase.txt`**: Contains the dependencies needed for Supabase integration.

2. **`main_clean.py`**: A clean FastAPI application entry point that doesn't rely on SQLAlchemy models.

3. **`database_supabase.py`**: Compatibility layer for modules that still require SQLAlchemy.

4. **`ws_manager_supabase.py`**: Supabase-compatible version of the WebSocket manager.

5. **`Dockerfile`**: Updated to use the Supabase implementation.

6. **`restart_docker.cmd`**: Windows-compatible script to build and run the Docker container.

## Conclusion

The Docker launch implementation has successfully transitioned from SQLite to Supabase at the infrastructure level, but further work is needed to fully implement all the application functionality using Supabase. The current implementation provides a solid foundation for continued development while maintaining compatibility with existing code where needed.

The most significant remaining challenge is setting up proper permissions in Supabase and implementing the API and WebSocket functionality using Supabase's features instead of SQLAlchemy.
